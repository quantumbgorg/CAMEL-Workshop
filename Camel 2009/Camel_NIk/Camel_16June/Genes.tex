We predict ground state cooling of a micro-mechanical oscillator, i.e. a
vibrating end-mirror of an optical cavity, by resonant coupling of mirror
vibrations to a narrow internal optical transition of an ensemble of two level
systems. The particles represented by a collective mesoscopic spin model
implement an efficient, frequency tailorable zero temperature loss channel
or alternatively can be turned to a gain channel of pump. Moreover, we show that
the steady state of the system shows tripartite and bipartite continuous
variable entanglement which is robust against temperature.
