Strong field multiphoton excitation in a three level resonant system was controlled using a 2D spatio-temporal scheme.  Temporal focusing is utilized in order to produce a spatially-dependent quadratic spectral phase, while a second, arbitrary phase parameter is scanned using a pulse shaper.  In the current work, we consider weak-to-strong field excitation of Rb85 by using a $\pi$-phase step and the quadratic phase as the control parameters. The intricate dependence of these parameters on the multilevel dynamics is demonstrated by mapping the data onto a two dimensional control landscape.  In this representation, it is easily seen that the regions of maximal population transfer in the resonant three-level system occur for specific combinations of the two control parameters, and the detailed features of the control space are interpreted using a dressed-state, time domain model. These spatio-temporal mappings should be an effective method for strong field coherent control in a variety of multilevel systems.
