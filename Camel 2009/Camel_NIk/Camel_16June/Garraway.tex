Dressed rf trapping is a new technique for
trapping and controlling cold atoms. For some time it
has been possible to trap neutral atoms in optical
dipole traps or in magnetic traps, but dressed rf traps
use a combination of rf and static magnetic fields
(with gravity). The rf with variable frequency,
polarization, and detuning, in combination with with
spatially varying magnetic fields offers new
versatility in atom trapping.
The talk will include the theoretical conception of
these traps, illustrations from some of the different
experimental approaches and theoretical developments on
trapping, cooling, and leakage.
