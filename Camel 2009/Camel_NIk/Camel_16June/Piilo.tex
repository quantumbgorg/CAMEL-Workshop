Recently developed non-Markovian quantum jump method allows to simulate open systems in structured reservoirs, and
provides new insight to non-Markovian dynamics [1]. Here we prove the existence of the corresponding novel stochastic process
and that master equations which are local in time can be unravelled through a piecewise deterministic quantum jump process in
its Hilbert space [2]. We derive a stochastic Schr\"{o}edinger equation that reveals how non-Markovian effects are manifested in
statistical correlations between different realizations of the process. Moreover, we demonstrate that possible violations of the
positivity of approximate master equations are closely connected to singularities of the stochastic Schroedinger equation, which
could lead to important insights into the structural characterization of positive non-Markovian equations of motion.
