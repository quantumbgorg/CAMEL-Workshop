The basic principles of the recently proposed Time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo technique
are outlined. The method solves quantum many-body problems ab initio by
propagating ensembles of trajectories and guiding waves in physical space.
We introduce effective potentials that incorporate the nonlocal quantum correlation effects between the electrons in atoms, molecules, and other structures subjected to external electromagnetic fields of arbitrary strength and duration.
