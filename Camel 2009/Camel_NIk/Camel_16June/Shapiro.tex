We present the solution of the non-degenerate bound state quantum
control problem, namely, the complete transfer of population between
arbitrary wave packets of non-degenerate energy eigenstates, and
report about the experimental demonstration of such a multi-state
adiabatic transfer using the ``piecewise adiabatic passage'' method.
