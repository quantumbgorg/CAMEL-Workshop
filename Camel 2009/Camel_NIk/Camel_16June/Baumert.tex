Ultrafast laser control is a fascinating facet of femtochemistry as it
seeks to steer any type of photophysical system from an initial state to
a predefined target state on intrinsic time scales with the help of
suitable shaped femtosecond laser pulses.
In this talk after a short introduction into the topic and the technique
I will highlight various projects from our laboratories ranging from
coherent to incoherent photophysical systems with a special emphasis on
the control of ionization processes in dielectrics leading to nano scale
structures.
