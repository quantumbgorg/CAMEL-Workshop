We study a single two-level atom interacting with a reservoir of modes
defined by its spectral function.  Considering exactly solvable
models, we try to quantify and examine the properties of entanglement
between different parts of the reservoir (both with and without the
atom). Our analysis makes use of different measures of entanglement,
such as the concurrence vector and the generalised entanglement. The
system evolution is determined both analytically, for certain limits,
and numerically, in the framework of a discrete bath. From our
analysis, we were able to derive entanglement properties between the
atom and the modes, and also between the reservoir modes.
