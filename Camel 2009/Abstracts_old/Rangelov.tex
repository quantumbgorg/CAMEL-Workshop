Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a well established technique
for producing coherent population transfer in a three-state quantum system
[1-3]. We here exploit the resemblance between the Schrödinger equation for
such a quantum system and the Newton equation of motion for a classical
system undergoing torque to discuss several classical analogs of STIRAP,
notably the motion of a moving charged particle subject to the Lorentz force
of a quasistatic magnetic field, the orientation of a magnetic moment in a
slowly varying magnetic field and the Coriolis effect. Like STIRAP, these
phenomena occur for \emph{counterintuitive} motion of the torque and are
robustly insensitive to small changes in the interaction properties.
