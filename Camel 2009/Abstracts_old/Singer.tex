We have realized a universal deterministic single ion source based
on a segmented ion trap applicable to a wide range of elements and
molecules. Doppler cooled ions are deterministically extracted and
detected with an efficiency of 90% [1].
We are targeting to reach nm resolution by the application of ion
optical elements. We currently try to apply electro-magnetically
induced transparency cooling to cool ion crystals to the motional
ground state. This would then realize a perfect matter wave source
at the Heisenberg limit. Our technique can e.g.~be applied to
generate color centers in diamond or to implant P into Si. Both
systems provide a possible way for the realization of a solid
state quantum computer [2]. In addition, the electrical properties
of semiconductor devices can be greatly enhanced by the
deterministic implantation of single ions.
