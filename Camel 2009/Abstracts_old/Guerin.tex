We present the technique of parallel adiabatic passage and its application to the control of quantum processes such as state-selectivity for atoms and molecules, and quantum information processing. Parallel adiabatic passage corresponds to an adiabatic passage for which the instantaneous eigenvalues are parallel at each time from a specific design of the pulses. This allows one to optimize the adiabaticity in the sense that the DDP non-adiabatic correction is zero. In practice the technique induces a very efficient population transfer in terms of pulse energy and duration, while preserving the standard robustness of adiabatic techniques. As an application, we have developed a STIRAP-like technique with appropriate chirped fields. It leads to an adiabatic population transfer with a pulse area as low as $3.5\pi$. This technique opens the possibility to implement STIRAP in picosecond regimes with interesting applications in quantum information processing.
