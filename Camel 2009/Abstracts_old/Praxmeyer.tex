For long distance quantum communication, distribution of entanglement over long distances, overcoming effects of noise and decoherence, is needed. Various quantum repeater schemes [1] were proposed to provide a theoretical solution of this problem. We shall present an optimized version of the hybrid quantum repeater [2,3], based on Gaussian optical-state communication, and Gaussian, homodyne-based, conditional entangled state preparation. We show that use od squeezed light significantly increases the fidelity of states obtained while probability of success is maintained.
