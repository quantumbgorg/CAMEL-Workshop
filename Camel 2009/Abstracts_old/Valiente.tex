We study the dynamical and statical properties of one, two and
three strongly-interacting bosons in a 1D tight-binding lattice.
We demonstrate that coherent transport of interaction-bound pairs
of particles -- ``dimers'' -- can be achieved, and that these composite
objects behave as single particles with a large effective mass.
We then discuss a ``dimer-monomer'' system and find novel kinds of
three-body bound states due to an effective exchange interaction
between the tightly bound dimer and monomer. We also study
dimer-monomer resonant collisions and entanglement of the
resulting wavepackets.
