We isolate the key mechanisms that lead to noise assisted transfer in
light-harvesting complexes. The first process
is the suppression of destructive interference in this network due to
local dephasing and the second is that of line
broadening of the excitonic levels. The latter can be thought of as
leading to enhanced transport via higher overlap
of neighbouring levels. The former can be visualized as introducing
distinguishability along the two paths in a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which subsequently opens up new paths for
transport in these complex. We also predict
the existence of quantum entanglement in the these biological molecules,
which can be probed using 2D femtosecond spectroscopic techniques.
