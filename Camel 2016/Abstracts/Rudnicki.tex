Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond are attracting much interest thanks to their
remarkable properties and possibility of exciting applications. Thanks to stable fluorescence,
paramagnetic ground state and long decoherence times, NV centers are promising candidates for
quantum-bits, sensors of magnetic and electric fields as well as for non-toxic biomarkers.
Understanding physical processes in  NV ensembles plays a key-role in the successful application.
We will present results of our recent studies of various nonlinear interactions of NV ensembles
with external fields, such as the  microwave hole-burning effect, the coherent population
oscillation and the cross relaxation between the NV centers.
