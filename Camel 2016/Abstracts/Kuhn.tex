We demonstrate quantum logic and quantum feedback using narrow linewidth photons that are produced with an a-priory non-probabilistic
scheme from a single atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity. We use a controlled-NOT gate integrated into a
photonic chip to entangle these photons, and we observe non-classical correlations between photon detection events separated by
periods exceeding the travel time across the chip by three orders of magnitude. Furthermore we apply a quantum-feedback scheme in a
two-photon interference setting that allows deliberate switching between bosonic and fermionic photon behaviour.
