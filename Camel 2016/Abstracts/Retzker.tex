In this talk I will give an overview of a few proposals and realisations of quantum gates with trapped ions.
In the first part of my talk I will discuss gates which are driven by microwave radiation and are being refocused with
continuous dynamical decoupling. In the second part of my talk I will introduce refocusing schemes that aim to eliminate
noise in two qubit gate terms which are usually more challenging to deal with than noise in local operations.
