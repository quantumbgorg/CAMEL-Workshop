Adiabatic frequency conversion is a method recently developed in nonlinear optics [1], using ideas from the technique of rapid adiabatic passage via a level crossing in quantum physics. In this method, the coupling coefficients are constant and the phase mismatch is chirped adiabatically. We propose another method for adiabatic frequency conversion, in which the phase mismatch is constant and the coupling is a pulse-shaped function with a sign flip (i.e., a phase step of $\pi$) at its maximum.
