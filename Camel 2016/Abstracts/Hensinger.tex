Trapped ions are a promising tool for building a large-scale quantum computer. The number of required radiation fields (such as lasers) for the realisation of quantum gates in any proposed ion-based architecture scales with the number of ions inside the quantum computer, posing a major challenge when imagining a device with millions of qubits. Here I present a fundamentally different approach, where this scaling entirely vanishes. The method is based on individually controlled voltages applied to each logic gate location to facilitate the actual gate operation analogous to a traditional transistor architecture within a classical computer processor. Instead of aligning numerous pairs of Raman laser beams into designated entanglement zones, the use of a single microwave source outside the vacuum system is sufficient. We have demonstrated the key principle of this approach by implementing a two-qubit quantum gate based on long-wavelength radiation where we generate a maximally entangled two-qubit state with fidelity 0.985(12). Finally, I will discuss the engineering blueprint for a large-scale microwave trapped-ion quantum computer and the construction of a demonstrator device at the University of Sussex.
