We will discuss the construction of the quantum theory of electromagnetic fields in
a structured medium that can have metallic and dielectric elements, and their interaction
with atoms, molecules and other quantum emitters, like quantum dots. We introduce the
concept of bright and dark plasmon-polariton modes and their use in the
construction of effective models.
