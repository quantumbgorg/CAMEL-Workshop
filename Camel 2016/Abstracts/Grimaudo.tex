In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a generalized Heisenberg model of two coupled spin-1
systems. We show that due to its symmetry properties, its nine-dimensional dynamics is decoupled
into two sub-spaces with well defined parity. The four-dimensional odd-parity subspace is
dynamically equivalent to a single spin-3/2 system, which can be further reduced to two non-interacting
spin-1/2 systems. The five-dimensional even-parity subspace can be described in terms
of a single spin-2 system. No approximations are invoked in the derivation of these results,
which, moreover, are applicable also when some parameters in the Hamiltonian are time dependent.
We disclose and scrutinize various intriguing features emerging in the dynamics of the system.
