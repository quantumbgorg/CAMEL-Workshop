In this talk we present recent progress in our lab concerning two of our experiments.

First, we discuss the status of our Brillouin LIDAR for the measurement of the temperature profile in the Ocean.
Specifically, we report on the results of a first field test in Italy and give an outlook of the future plans.

During the second part of the talk we will detail the advances of our efforts building a UV laser based on lasing without inversion. After a
recent theoretical study has shown the feasibility of our approach employing a four level double dark scheme  in
mercury, we have now started to fully implement the experiment. We will discuss the absorption spectra of a weak probe
at the intended laser wavelength showing Doppler-free three photon coherence.
