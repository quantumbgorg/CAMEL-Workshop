Microscopes are one of the devices, that are highly needed in various scientific areas, e.g. biology, medicine, material science, chemistry etc. Today exist plenty of microscopic techniques with high plane, vertical or time resolution, that are capable of measuring different properties of the sample. To make a satisfying research we would need to use more than one technique, but that requires few microscopes and mowing the sample between them. One of solutions is to combine more techniques into one device, where they could work simultaneously and create informations with high spatial, vertical and time resolution at the same time. I will first present some of the microscopic techniques, the way to unite them and the difficulties of that task. Then I will briefly introduce devices developed by our company qutools, that could be used in a new modulated microscope. I will state few examples of a wanted device, there advantages, disadvantages and how they could be upgraded.
