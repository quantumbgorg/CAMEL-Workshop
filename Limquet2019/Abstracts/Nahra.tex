The negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV-) centers in diamonds have emerged as a very promising candidate for quantum emitters due to their narrow emission line.[1]
Modifying the emission properties and enhancing the interaction strength of (SiV-) coupled to a novel nanophotonic platform, based on the so called ion exchange waveguides, is a challenge for integrated quantum photonics.

This work aims to study and compare physical properties of nanodiamonds NDs and optical properties of SiV- centers in NDs prepared under the same HPHT conditions [2] but with different conditions. We present the effect of growth temperature, and
treatment methods on the morphology, crystallinity of nanodiamonds and on the optical properties of SiVin nanodiamonds.
