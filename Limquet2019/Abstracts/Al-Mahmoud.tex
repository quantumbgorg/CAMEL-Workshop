We propose a new scheme of a tunable Polarization rotator with arbitrary angle of rotation for a wide range of wavelength. It is composed by a sequence of three wave plates, two of which serve as half wave plates and one serves as a full wave plate with respect to the central wavelength. All the wave plates are intentionally rotated at specific angles with respect to their fast-polarization axes in order that the device is broadband by using the composite pulses analogies, from the quantum mechanics. This rotator is robust against the initial polarization direction as well.
