Precise control over all properties of light is essential not only for experimental studies of light-matter interaction, but also for successful integration of technologies in quantum systems. Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) are standard components in laboratories since they offer a fast and versatile tool for manipulation of various light properties, making them ideal for amplitude, phase, frequency and position tuning of lasers. However, with the current commercially available technologies, it is necessary to use different electro-optic devices to address different properties of light, which increases the complexity of the optical systems. Here I present the first step towards the creation of a universal EOM that provides different types of modulation at once in a single device. I present the basic working principle of a device that combines phase and amplitude modulation, as well as the experimental tools necessary for its characterization.
