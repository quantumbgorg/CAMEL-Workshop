Our group has been designing and performing proof of concept experiments majorly focused on
frequency-bin entanglement since 2010. Entanglement manipulation in the frequency domain is a
relatively new concept and has recently gained attention for its robustness and scalability.
Entanglement manipulation in the frequency domain is an attractive candidate to replace other
conventional manipulation systems because (i) the frequency domain naturally offers high
dimensionality, and (ii) building blocks such as frequency entangled source, modulators and filters
involved in the manipulation method can be integrated on chip. This is why the frequency degree of
freedom in quantum photonic undoubtedly offers a promising platform for scalable and robust quantum
information processing.

This talk covers the basics of frequency-bin entanglement and provides the experimental results and
insights into implementing novel manipulation techniques to make the system more efficient, stable and
robust.
