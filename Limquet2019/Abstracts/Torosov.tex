The technique of composite pulses has the unique advantage of combining ultrahigh accuracy similar to resonant techniques with robustness to parameter imperfections similar to adiabatic passage techniques. It is a method which has been primarily developed in nuclear magnetic resonance several decades ago. In the recent years, however, an increasing interest has been devoted to study the composite pulses, especially in the context of coherent control, quantum optics and quantum information. In this tutorial we introduce the theoretical approach behind the derivation of composite sequences and review many applications in different physical systems.
