Strings of trapped ions form a useful system to realize quantum algorithms and quantum simulations. Using a combination of high-fidelity gate operations with optical pumping we can currently experimentally realize unitary and non-unitary operations with up to 14 qubits and up to 100 gate operations. We will report on our recent progress using this technique, in particular, the generation of GHZ states of up to 14 ion qubits, the realization of an open-system quantum simulator, and the quantum error correction of a measurement projection.
