Single self-assembled quantum dots are established emitters of single photons and entangled photon pairs. Nevertheless, to be used in quantum optics experiments where coherent properties of the excitation need to be transferred to the system, quantum dots need to be excited resonantly and coherently.
We report the first demonstration of coherently created deterministic biexciton-exciton photon cascade in a single self-assembled InAs quantum dot embedded in a microcavity using a resonant two-photon excitation. The resonant nature of the excitation was confirmed by the observation of the Rabi oscillations. Due to the deterministic nature of the excitation process the measurements of the auto-correlations of both exciton and biexciton photons show the full suppression of multiple photon emission. In addition, we show that the coherence time of the biexciton state can be extended with an all-optical echo technique that has never been attempted before for an excitonic qubit in a quantum dot.
The combination of the short lifetime provided by the Purcell enhancement of the micro-cavity and the resonant excitation makes this system well suitable for schemes like time-bin entanglement or probabilistic interaction of the photons originating from dissimilar sources.
