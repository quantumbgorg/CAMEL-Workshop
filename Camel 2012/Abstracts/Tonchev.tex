Grover's search algorithm is used for unsorted data base search. It can be used alone only when there is one element which matches the searching conditions. When there is more of one, it must be used quantum counting before applying Grover's algorithm. Here is examined quantum counting for Grover search, where is discussed qunits in place of qubits.
