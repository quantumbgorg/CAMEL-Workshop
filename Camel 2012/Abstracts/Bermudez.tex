The quest of finding experimental platforms where the interplay of low dimensionality, frustration, and quantum fluctuations can be
controlled is a fundamental challenge of quantum many-body physics. In this talk, I will discuss the possibility of using cold crystals
of trapped ions to face this challenge. In particular, I will show that trapped ions can explore two paradigmatic many-body effects: (i)
the competition of quantum fluctuations and magnetic frustration in a variety of ladder structures (i.e. frustrated Ising ladders), and
(ii) the interplay of cooperative magnetic ordering and structural phase transitions of the ion crystal (i.e. Spin-Peierls instability).
