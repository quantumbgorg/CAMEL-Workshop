Adiabatic evolution of light in parallel curved optical waveguide array is theoretically investigated.
This problem is shown to bear a close connection with coherent population transfer in a bow-tie
model for atoms and molecules. For the presented models complete light transfer between the outer
waveguides is achieved, and the respective conditions of validity are given. These conditions impose
certain restrictions on the geometry of the waveguides and on the optical properties of the system.
The case of three waveguides is analysed using the solutions of the well known bow-tie model. For the
case of more than three waveguides the system can be reduced to a number of three-level waveguide sub-systems.
The latter is illustrated on the specific example of an array of four waveguides. Analytic
results supported by numerics are derived for complete light transfer.
