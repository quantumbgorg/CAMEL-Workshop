We present new shortcuts to adiabaticity, for example a shortcut to adiabatic transport of a
condensate in a harmonic trap. In this case, the trap is moved from the initial to the final
position in arbitrarily short time without excitations of the condensate. Moreover, we present new
shortcuts to speed up adiabatic passage from one internal atomic state to another in a two-level
atom. Especially, we examine and compare the stability of different schemes concerning different
types of errors like noise errors and systematic errors.
