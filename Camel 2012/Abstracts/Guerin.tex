The control of quantum systems by external fields (such as laser and cavity fields) is at the heart of modern applications in physics and chemistry, ranging from quantum information processing to the control of chemical reactions.
It can be in general formulated as the control of population transfer between photonic, atomic and molecular levels.
We develop techniques that allow the design of the external fields for specific controls. One of the most challenging issues is the ability to achieve a population transfer in a robust way, with respect to fluctuations of the fields and to the partial knowledge of the system more generally, with a high-fidelity, and in a fast way to avoid decohering processes. We discuss the technique of parallel adiabatic passage that satisfy optimally these constraints, even in the presence of Stark shifts.
Quantum control by designed laser pulses is applied for the control of vibrational and rotational molecular degrees of freedom. We show the implementation of quantum cogwheels only based on the rotational control.
We also discuss the production and the shaping of multiphoton states leaking out from a cavity driven by a laser field.
