Quantum correlations in separable noisy quantum states quantified by non-classicality measures such as, e.g., quantum discord are currently attracting increasing attention and may change our understanding of what the ultimate QIP resources are. Notably, these quantum correlations beyond entanglement also bring along a different perception of noise in quantum systems. Controlled quantum noise, correlated noise, and tailored dissipative processes can all be transformed into useful tools. Quantifiers of non-classical correlations, such as quantum discord, remarkably unite coherence with changes in entropy in quantum systems coupled to the environment and link coherent and dissipative dynamics together. To demonstrate this, we study a few of the general quantum correlations in two particular systems, which exhibit counterintuitive effects.
