The creation of mesoscopic entangled states is one of the
fundamental challenges in quantum optics since they are very useful as
resources for optical quantum information, quantum metrology, and
super-precision lithography. In the present work (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 123603 (2012) we
propose a novel system for the efficient production of optical NOON states
based on the resonant interaction of a pair of quantized cavity modes with
an ensemble of atoms. We show that in the strong-coupling regime the
adiabatic evolution of the system tends to a limiting state that describes
mesoscopic entanglement between photons and atoms which can easily be
converted to a purely photonic or atomic NOON state. We also demonstrate the
remarkable property that the efficiency of our scheme increases
exponentially well with the cavity cooperativity factor, which gives
efficient access to high number NOON states. The experimental feasibility of
the scheme is discussed and its efficiency is demonstrated numerically.
