We propose a fast and efficient technique to create classes of highly entangled states in trapped ions, such as NOON states, Dicke states and superpositions of these.
The ions are initialized in the phonon ground state and are addressed globally with a composite pulse that is resonant with the first sideband, red or blue.
Consequently, the technique operates on comparatively short time scales, typically less than 1 ms.
The approach does not require individual access to the ions in the trap and can be applied both inside and outside the Lamb-Dicke regime.
