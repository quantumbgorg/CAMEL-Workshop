Trapped ions are ideally suited for the Analogical Quantum Simulation of Condensed Matter models. In this talk I will present two recent theoretical proposals:

We show how ions trapped in an array of microtraps can simulate the physics of charged particles under the presence of a magnetic field. Our idea relies on the periodic driving of the trap frequencies which allows to dress the phase of the vibrational excitations, in such a way that ions implement a tight-biding model with an effective gauge field. Our proposal allows us to access the physics of a phonon quantum Hall effect in trapped ion setups.

We study theoretically a system of trapped ions with strong spin-boson couplings and show that it implements a cooperative Jahn-Teller model. Our calculations predict a quantum structural phase transition, where the crystal distortion is entangled with an effective quantum magnetic state.
