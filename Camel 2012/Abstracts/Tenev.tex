We have explored the properties of spin splitting for neutral particles possessing electric and
magnetic dipole moments moving in electromagnetic fields. We have found two notable features of spin
splitting and the associated Larmor precession which are consequences of special relativity. First we
report the existence of upper limit of spin splitting equal to the mass gap for the particle and
corresponding upper limit for the Larmor precession. Second we predict the noninvariance of the spin
splitting with respect to Lorentz boosts. Finally we have proposed several experimental set-ups that
can test the predictions.
