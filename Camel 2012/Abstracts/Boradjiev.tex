We consider the phenomenon of decreasing of the spectral line width with increasing the coupling
strength (power narrowing) for the case of two-level system coherently driven by a bell-shaped
symmetrical pulse, and a constant detuning. Specifically, we consider couplings with exponentially and
power-low falling wings. Picturing the problem in the adiabatic basis, by means of analysis of the
adiabatic condition, we show that power narrowing is possible when the asymptotic behavior of the
coupling function is given by a power-low $\sim (t/T)^{-q}$. The results are of potential
application in high-precision spectroscopy.
