The theory of open quantum systems with time-dependent Hamiltonian, developed by Davies and Spohn, is reviewed. The master equations governing the dissipative dynamics in STIRAP and for the Landau-Zener model are derived. A comparison between the predictions of the master equations and previous phenomenological models is given, showing that important differences may arise when the decay rates are large enough. Finally some numerical results are shown in order to discuss the limitations of the master equation approach.
