We present a method to suppress unwanted {transition} channels and achieve perfect population transfer in multistate quantum systems, even when the relevant couplings have unknown values, by the application of composite pulse sequences.
Unwanted transition channels can be activated, for example, by deviations in light polarization.
Compensation with respect to simultaneous deviations in polarization, pulse area, and detuning are demonstrated.
The accuracy, the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed technique make it suitable for various applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing.
