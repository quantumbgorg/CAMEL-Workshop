Advancements in high harmonic generation (HHG) have led to the development of table-top XUV and soft X-ray light sources for attosecond science.  However, the very low conversion efficiency of HHG, particularly for longer wavelength driving laser fields, poses a significant practical limitation for the use of these sources in many experimental applications.  To compensate for the low single atom efficiency, phase matching methods are typically implemented in order to extend the effective generation length in the atomic medium.  In this work, we demonstrate a different approach to optimizing HHG that enhances the single atom response to the driving laser field.  We show that using a bichromatic driving field, subcycle control of the tunnel ionization dynamics can be achieved, leading to considerable enhancement of the ionization rate compared with a single colour field.  Resultant increases in HHG efficiency by over two orders of magnitude have been observed.  Our method offers a simple route toward scalable, robust XUV sources and the advancement of HHG spectroscopy, where isolating the single atom or molecule response is essential and exploiting phase matching schemes is not possible.
