In this talk we present the current status of two of our experiments.
First, we present recent progress on the characterisation of our single photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down conversion in quantum key distribution. In particular, we discuss the spectral properties of the generated photons.

During the second part of the talk we will detail the advances of our efforts building a UV laser based on lasing without inversion. After a recent theoretical study has shown the principle feasibility of our approach employing a four level double dark scheme in mercury [1], our first measurements regarding amplification without inversion (AWI) lead to the observation of Doppler-free three-photon coherences. While our pump was not strong enough to show AWI, the theoretical model is in good agreement with our results and a prediction for the necessary pump power was determined [2].
