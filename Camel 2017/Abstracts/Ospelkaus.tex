We present experiments with single 9Be$^+$ ions with applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In surface-electrode ion traps, we trap single 9Be$^+$ ions at an intermediate magnetic field strength where selected hyperfine states form a first order magnetic-field independent qubit for long coherence times. We discuss the design and operation of tailored near-field microwave waveguides embedded into the structure for full spin-motional control over these qubit states. We discuss applications of the near-field approach in quantum information processing and quantum many-body physics and present an extension of our trap fabrication capabilities to tailored, planarized and multi-layer structures. We further present ideas and concepts to use single 9Be$^+$ ions for sympathetic cooling and detection of (anti-)protons for precision measurements. We discuss a cryogenic Penning trap apparatus based on the BASE experiment to implement these ideas and present first experimental results on laser systems for controlling 9Be$^+$ at high magnetic field in a Penning trap, based on direct frequency comb control. We acknowledge funding by DFG through CRC1227 DQ-mat, projects A01 and B06 and ERC StG ``QLEDS''. This project is part of and supported by the BASE collaboration.
