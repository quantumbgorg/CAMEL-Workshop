We describe the progress of the theoretical and experimental work on developing an optical simulator for generic dephasing dynamics. The simulator system is the polarization of a single photon and its dynamics is induced by interaction with the frequency degree of freedom of the photon [1]. The total
polarization ­frequency system is prepared in specific correlated states to induce the desired dynamics.
As an example dynamics to be simulated, we use the well-studied Loschmidt echo of a central spin
coupled to an Ising chain in a transverse field [2]. To illustrate the versatility of the simulator, we have
chosen to simulate the Loschmidt echo in three fundamentally different cases: below, above, and exactly
at the critical value of the strength of the transverse field.
