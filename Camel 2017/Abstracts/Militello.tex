Evaluating the dynamics of a circuit QED single-qubit driven by a time-dependent interaction modulated by a linearly varying frequency, it can be singled out that effective Landau-Zener processes are responsible for a significant photon production. To asses experimental feasibility, a Markovian quantum noise is considered and its effects are evaluated, also comparing different approaches.
