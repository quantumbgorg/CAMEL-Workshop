Trapped Rydberg ions are a novel quantum system [1]. By combining the high degree of control of trapped ion systems with the long-range dipole-dipole interactions of Rydberg atoms [2], fast entanglement gates may be realized in large ion crystals [3].
Quantum information processing in this system is envisaged to use low-lying electronic states for storage of qubits and strongly interacting Rydberg states for entanglement operations. This requires the Rydberg excitation to be coherently controlled.
In our experiment [4] we have observed the first coherent Rydberg excitations of an ion via a two-photon excitation to Rydberg S states. Coherent effects observed include Rabi oscillations, EIT and STIRAP. We also report the realization of microwave-dressed Rydberg ions driving the transition between Rydberg S and P states. This marks an important step towards realizing entanglement operations between Rydberg ions, which are envisaged to strongly interact with each other via the large oscillating dipole moments of microwave-dressed Rydberg states.
