States of coherent superposition play a significant role in quantum optics and related fields. Applications are known in high precision measurements, atomic clocks, quantum information. Simple techniques for generating equal superposition states like a resonant $\pi/2$ pulse do not always work since they suffer efficiency limitations due to fluctuations of the control parameters and the environment. Among the various more sophisticated techniques are DEQSIE [1], shortcuts to adiabaticity and composite pulses for generating such states.
Adiabatic techniques on the other hand have been harnessed for achieving robust population transfer and specific superposition states. We propose here a two-level adiabatic excitation scheme for generation of arbitrary superposition states via specific overlap of the Rabi frequency and the detuning's temporal profile. We use three known analytical models to demonstrate our approach: two trigonometric models and limiting cases of the hyperbolic Demkov-Kunike model.
