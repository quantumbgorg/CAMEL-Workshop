Quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation defines fundamental limits on the capacity of optical communication channels. Approaching the quantum limits requires a change of paradigm from measuring quantities well defined in classical systems, such as amplitude or phase, to exploiting quantum state distinguishability. These issues are especially pertinent in the regime of low signal power, which is currently explored e.g. for deep-space satellite communication at optical frequencies.
