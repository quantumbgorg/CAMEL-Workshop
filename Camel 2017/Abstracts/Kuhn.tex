We demonstrate quantum logic and quantum feedback using narrow linewidth photons that are produced with an a-priory non-probabilistic scheme from a single atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity [1]. We use a controlled-NOT gate integrated into a photonic chip to entangle these photons [2], and we observe non-classical correlations between photon detection events separated by periods exceeding the travel time across the chip by three orders of magnitude. Furthermore we apply a quantum-feedback scheme in a two-photon interference setting that allows deliberate switching between bosonic and fermionic photon behaviour [3].
