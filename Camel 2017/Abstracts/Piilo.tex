Photons have recently been used to simulate open system dynamics and to control non-Markovian memory effects in their dynamics. This has also allowed the realization of non-local memory effects and their exploitation in superdense coding. In the current work we exploit initial frequency entanglement between the photons and show theoretically how this can be converted to their polarization entanglement by local processes only. This opens the possibility, e.g., to prepare polarization entanglement remotely by using local dephasing processes and also to detect frequency entanglement by polarization measurements.
