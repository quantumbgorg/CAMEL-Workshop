Due to fast experimental progress, it becomes increasingly important to model quantum optical systems more and more accurately.
Motivated by this, we revisit the derivation of the master equation of a two-level atom within a radiation field but without employing
the rotating wave and certain other Markovian approximations. We consider a set of unitarily equivalent Hamiltonians, each referring
to physically different components as representing the ``atom'' and the ``field'' and each resulting in a different master equation.
The only way of obtaining a master equation which does {em not} predict a non-zero stationary state photon emission rate even in
the absence of external driving is to use the {em rotating wave} Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian might indeed yield the most accurate
master equation.
