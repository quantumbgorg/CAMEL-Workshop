Much effort has been directed in recent years towards understanding the dissociation dynamics of
molecules using intense laser fields, and toward achieving efficient photodissociation via quantum
coherent control. We present a method to control photodissociation by manipulating the bond
softening mechanism occurring in strong (10$^{12}$ -- 10$^{14}$ W/cm$^{2}$) shaped laser fields.  By
modulating the second and third order spectral phases of ultrafast pulses -- i.e. the pulse GDD and
TOD -- we demonstrate the ability to control dissociation rates of H$_{2}^{+}$ ions from targeted
vibrational levels.
