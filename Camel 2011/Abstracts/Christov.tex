We outline the basic principles of the recently proposed time-dependent
quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. TDQMC solves quantum many-body problems
ab initio by propagating ensembles of walkers and guiding waves in physical
space where the walker distribution reproduces the density of the quantum
particles. The method is applied to three-dimensional para- and
ortho-helium atoms subjected to an external electromagnetic field with
amplitude sufficient to cause significant tunneling ionization. By solving
concurrently sets of up to 20 000 coupled 3D time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger
equations for the guide waves and corresponding sets of first order
equations of motion for the Monte Carlo walkers we obtain ground state
energies in close agreement with the exact values. Our results for the
dipole response and the ionization of uncorrelated atoms are in good
agreement with the predictions of the conventional Hartree-Fock method
while the correlated atoms show enhanced ionization that is due to the
electron-electron repulsion.
