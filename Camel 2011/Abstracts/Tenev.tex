The electric dipole moment of neutrons and other elementary particles is predicted to exist by both the
standard model of high energy physics and various extensions of it. The predicted value of the electric
dipole moment is beyond the experimental limits at present time. Thus the electric dipole moment has
not been observed experimentally so far. We have proposed to simulate and emulate the electric dipole
moment of neutron and the effects that it causes in presence of static electrostatic fields. The
proposal is based on simulation of extended Dirac equation in ion traps.
