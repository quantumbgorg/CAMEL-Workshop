Coherent interactions of light and matter often exhibit stunning features, which permit improvements and applications in all fields of optical physics. As an example for surprising effects of rather simple, coherent excitations we discuss applications of coherent population return (CPR). In CPR the atomic population in a two-level system is adiabatically driven forth and back between two quantum states. During CPR, the system reaches a state of maximal coherence. Both the coherent transfer process, as well as the maximal coherence permits surprising applications. In particular, we will show implementations of CPR to completely suppress power broadening in applied spectroscopy, e.g. laser-based trace isotope detection. In a very different application, CPR also serves to support frequency conversion processes of ultra-short laser pulses towards extreme-ultraviolet radiation. CPR enhances the conversion efficiency and significantly increases the stability in the nonlinear optical process.
