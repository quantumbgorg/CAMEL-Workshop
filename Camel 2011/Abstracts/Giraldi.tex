A two-level system interacting with a continuous distribution of
field modes is considered.
The aim of the work is to induce a decoherence process that is slower than the
usual exponential relaxations, by engineering appropriate reservoirs of field
modes. For this reason a special class of reservoirs is designed, with a
continuous distributions of field modes. The reservoirs exhibit a band-gap edge
coinciding with the transition frequency of the two-level systems and the
corresponding spectral densities are piece-wise similar to those usually
adopted in Quantum Optics, i.e., sub-ohmic at low frequencies and inverse power
laws at high frequencies. The exact dynamics of the two-level system, described
by the reduced density matrix, is evaluated through the Fox $H$-functions and,
especially, over estimated long time scales, decoherence results in inverse
power law relaxations, with power decreasing continuously to unity, according
to the choice of the special reservoir.
