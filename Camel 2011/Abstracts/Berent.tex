Recently, an increasing efforts are put into the research on multiphoton processes in atoms and molecules [1,2]. As some of the atomic and molecular transitions lies in XUV range, those processes offers a valuable means for coherent manipulation of the mentioned systems.
We generalize our recent analytic approach [3] to include the effects of strong depopulation of the initial state when considering the multiphoton population transfer and scattering of low-frequency light by a three-level system in the lambda-type configuration. By utilizing the two approximations, i.e., the adiabatic and generalized rotating-wave approximations, we were able to find the analytic formulas describing the population dynamics and the coherent part of the related light-scattering spectrum under the condition of even-photon resonance.
