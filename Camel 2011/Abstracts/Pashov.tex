The wide spectrum of phenomena, observed and studied in the physics of cold atomic collisions need a
reliable and comprehensive description. In this presentation a brief overview of existing techniques
is given with special accent put on the models based on the potential energy curves. The importance of
usually neglected effects (for example breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, hyperfine
structure) is discussed.
