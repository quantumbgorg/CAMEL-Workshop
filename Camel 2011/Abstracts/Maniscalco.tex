We study the dynamics of quantum information flow in an ultracold atom set-up, specifically, a
qubit system of an impurity atom in a double well potential immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensed
reservoir. We demonstrate how the information flux between the qubit and the reservoir can be manipulated
by experimentally accessible variables. We place a particular emphasis on non-Markovian
dynamics, characterized by a reversed flow of information from the background gas to the qubit
and identify a crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in the system parameter
space.
