Enforcing non-classical behaviors in mesoscopic systems open to the effects of a surrounding environment is an important problem. Here we show that non-classicality in a massive mechanical system consisting of two vibrating mirrors of an optical resonator is enforced by an indirect coupling to the internal degrees of freedom of a trapped particle. Continuous-variable quantum correlations, detectable through a standard phase-space approach, are enforced between the mirrors. In a similar system (with a single harmonic oscillator), it is also possible to detect a geometric phase induced by the interaction with the environment.
