We report on the first study of the non-phase-matched degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) involving pump beams carrying 2-D spatial phase dislocations in the form of optical vortices. Our theoretical model is based on a set of ten coupled nonlinear partial differential Schr\"{o}dinger-type equations for ten frequency components, which take into account two-dimensional beam diffraction, FWM, as well as self- and cross-phase modulation effects. To verify the predictions we conducted experiments in an Ar-filled gas cell with a 1 kHz train of amplified 30-fs-pulses. We observed the generation of a broad supercontinuum spanning from less than 500 nm to more than 950 nm. To test the phase structure of the different spectral components of the continuum, we performed interferometric measurements in every 40-nm-wide spectral window within this interval. The results demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, the generation of white-light singular beams through nonlinear frequency conversion.
