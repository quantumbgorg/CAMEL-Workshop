Coherent control using quantum light is shown to give rise to a direct way
of writing arbitrary sequences of entangled atom-ion pairs. The method
relies on the proven ability to control the directionality of motion of
the valence electrons in dissociation processes giving rise to either the
``forward'' $\ket{f}$ or ``backward'' $\ket{b}$ products. By irradiating a one dimensional
array of molecular ions (such as Ca$^{2+}$) in an optical lattice with a
combination of a quantum-light Cat state $\ket{\alpha(\omega)}+\ket{-\alpha(\omega)}$
and an $\ket{\alpha(\omega/2)}$ coherent state at half the frequency, one can
entangle light with matter and craft entangled states composed of
arbitrary superpositions of sequences of atom-ion pairs, such as
$\ket{-\alpha(\omega)}\ket{f}\ket{f}\ket{b}\ldots+\ket{\alpha(\omega)}\ket{b}\ket{b}\ket{f}\ldots$.
In the second part of the talk I shall discuss the exciting possibility
of powering and tele-guiding ``walking'' molecules on surfaces using
classical light coherent control techniques.
