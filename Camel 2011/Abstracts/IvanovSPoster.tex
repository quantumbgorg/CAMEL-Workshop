A vital requirement for a quantum computer is the ability to locally address, with high fidelity, any of its qubits without affecting their neighbors. We propose an addressing method using composite sequences of laser pulses, which reduces dramatically the addressing error in a lattice of closely spaced atoms or ions, and at the same time significantly enhances the robustness of qubit manipulations.
To this end, we design novel high-fidelity composite pulses for the most important single-qubit operations.
In principle, this method allows one to beat the diffraction limit, for only atoms situated in a small spatial region around the center of the laser beam are excited, well within the laser beam waist.
