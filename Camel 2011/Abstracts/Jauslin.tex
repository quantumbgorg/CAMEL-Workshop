We describe quantum and classical Hamiltonian dynamics in a common Hilbert space framework, that allows the treatment of mixed
quantum-classical systems. The analysis of some examples illustrates the possibility of entanglement between classical and
quantum systems. We give a summary of the main tools of Berezin-Toeplitz and geometric quantization, that provide a relation
between the classical and the quantum models, based essentially on the selection of a subspace of the classical Hilbert space.
Coherent states provide a systematic tool for the inverse process, called dequantization, that associates a  classical Hamiltonian
system to a given quantum dynamics through the choice of a complete set of coherent states.
