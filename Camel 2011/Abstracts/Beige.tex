Calculations based on the Lamb-Dicke approximation suggest that cavity cooling and ordinary laser cooling are essentially the
same. However, going beyond this approximation we obtain very different results. It is shown that there are certain parameter
regimes, where the mean phonon number of the trapped particles experiences strong fluctuations and the time evolution of the
system becomes unstable. One of the results presented in this contribution are stability conditions for cavity-based laser cooling. We
try to identify the origin of the breakdown of the validity of semiclassical approximations in cavity cooling and discuss possible
experimental consequences.
