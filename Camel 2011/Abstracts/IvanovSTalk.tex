We present a simple scalable technique for construction of highly conditional C$^n$-NOT quantum gates of trapped ion qubits, such as the Toffoli gate, without using ancilla states and circuits of an exorbitant number of concatenated one- and two-qubit gates.
Apart from the initial dressing of the internal qubit states with vibrational phonons and the final restoration of the phonon ground state,
our technique requires the application of just a single composite pulse on the target qubit and is applicable both in and outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. We design special narrowband composite pulses, which suppress all transitions but the conditional transition of the target qubit;
moreover, these composite pulses significantly improve the spatial addressing selectivity.
