Probabilistic entanglement of distant atoms can be achieved by entanglement swapping acting on photons emitted from both atoms. Here we discuss the essential first step, namely the photon generation in a cavity, in a real-world scenario [1]. In particular we focus on polarisation control and spin-polarisation coupling in a birefringent optical cavity, and we do also take  non-linear Zeeman shifts into account. Furthermore we demonstrate quantum logic [2], feedback [3] and supremacy when operating integrated photonic chips with cavity photons.
