We investigate the possibility to optically manipulate Rydberg states of 2-valence electron atoms using doubly excited states. In this prospect, we have performed precise measurements of auto-ionization of Ytterbium atoms in doubly excited Rydberg states 6pnl and compare our results with theoretical expectations.
