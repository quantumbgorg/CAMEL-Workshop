We derive the dynamical invariants for a general N-state quantum system described by a pseudo-Hermitian
Hamiltonian. Explicit expressions are presented for two- and three-state systems, which are exemplified
by explicit analytic solutions for constant couplings. In the two-state case, we derive non-Hermitian
analogs of the Bloch vector and the Bloch equation, customary for Hermitian quantum systems. We
suggest possible physical implementations of the dynamical invariants in waveguide optics and frequency
conversion.
