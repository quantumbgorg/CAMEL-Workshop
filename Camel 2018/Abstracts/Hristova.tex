We propose an adiabatic method for transfer of light in a three-waveguide directional coupler in a single mode[1]. In our scheme the propagation coefficients of the two outer waveguides are identical, but may vary simultaneously along the propagation direction. Here we may have initially any light input in each of the waveguides and any order of coupling coefficients. Consequently, all three adiabatic eigenstates of the system are used in the dynamics. These solutions allow us to design some interesting waveguide devices.
