Coherent nonlinear microscopy (CNM) is widely used in three-dimensional imaging of transparent samples, particularly for biological tissues [1]. Examples for parametric and label free CNM processes are second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG). However, working under far off-resonant excitation conditions usually leads to low optical conversion efficiencies. Hence, the typically low signals may lead to a bad signal-to-noise ratio and low image contrast. There are several approaches to enhance the signal yield in CNM, e.g. using dispersion to optimize the phase-matching integral [2]. One promising concept is the ``Enhancement of Second-Order Nonlinear-Optical Signals by Optical Stimulation'' [3]. The basic idea is to stimulate a nonlinear signal by already ``seeding'' with some radiation at the harmonic frequency. The previous and first demonstration of the concept for SHG yielded signal enhancements more than 10 in a biologically relevant medium. We present strong enhancements of third harmonic generation by optical stimulation in a microscopy setup. The effect is most pronounced at low laser intensity and weak nonlinear susceptibilities, making it suitable in harmonic microscopy.
