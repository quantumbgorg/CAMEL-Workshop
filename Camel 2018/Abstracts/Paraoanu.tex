The achievement of fast and error-insensitive control of quantum systems is a primary  goal  in  quantum  information  science.   Here  we  use  the  first  three  levels  of  a transmon  superconducting  circuit  to  realize  a  loop  driving  scheme,  with  all  three possible  pairs  of  states  coupled  by  pulsed  microwave  tones.   In  this  configuration, we implement a superadiabatic protocol for population transfer, where two couplings produce the standard stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, while the third is a counterdiabatic field which suppresses the nonadiabatic excitations.  We demonstrate that the population can be controlled by the synthetic gauge-invariant phase around the loop as well as by the amplitudes of the three pulses.  The technique enables fast operation, with transfer times approaching the quantum speed limit, and it is remarkably robust against errors in the shape of the pulses.
