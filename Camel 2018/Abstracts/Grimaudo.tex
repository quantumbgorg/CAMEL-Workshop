The exact quantum dynamics of a single spin-1/2 in a generic time-dependent classical magnetic field is investigated and compared with the quantum motion of a spin-1/2 studied by Rabi and Schwinger.
The possibility of regarding the scenario studied in this paper as a generalization of that considered by Rabi and Schwinger is discussed and time-dependent resonance and out of resonance conditions are introduced and carefully legitimated and analysed.
Several examples help to disclose analogies and departures of the quantum motion induced in a generalized Rabi system with respect to that exhibited by the spin-1/2 in a magnetic field precessing around the $z$-axis.
We find that, under generalized resonance condition, the time evolution of the transition probability $P_+^-(t)$ between the two eigenstates of $\hat{S}^z$ may be dominated by a regime of distorted oscillations, or may even exhibit a monotonic behaviour.
At the same time we succeed in predicting no oscillations or even oscillations of maximum amplitude in the behaviour of $P_+^-(t)$ under generalized out of resonance condition.
New scenarios of experimental interest originating a Landau-Zener transition is brought to light.
