A simple wavemeter for measuring the wavelength of CW diode lasers is presented. The device is based on coloured glass filter transmission and its resolution is demonstrated to be better than 1$\mathrm{\AA}$. A group of factors, which have influence on accuracy and reproducibility of test results, are analysed. The presented results are from testing the wavemeter with CW diode laser and Ti:Al$_2$O$_3$ laser. Some useful applications of the device will be shown.
