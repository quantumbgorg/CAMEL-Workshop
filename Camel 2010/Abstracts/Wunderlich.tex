Laser cooled atomic ions confined in an electrodynamic cage have
been very successfully used for quantum information processing.
Recently, laser-less addressing of ions and Magnetic Gradient
Induced Coupling (MAGIC) between ion spins and their motion using
rf radiation (prerequisite for conditional quantum
dynamics with trapped ions) has been demonstrated for the first time
[1]. Using MAGIC, several technological and fundamental hurdles on
the path towards a scalable trapped ion quantum simulator may be
overcome. An issue that remains is the necessity to use magnetic
field sensitive states that are susceptible to ambient noise fields
limiting their coherence time. Here, we report on experiments with
Yb+ ions showing that the use of microwave dressed states may
enhance the coherence time of these states by up to two orders of
magnitude. Dresses states were prepared and probed using a modified
STIRAP sequence.
