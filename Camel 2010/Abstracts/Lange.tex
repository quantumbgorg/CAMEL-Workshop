An interface between quantum states of ions and photons is a tool of central importance in quantum information processing, linking the two most important qubit carriers. To couple the quantum states of ions and photons reversibly and with high fidelity is a challenging task, requiring as a tight integration of miniature optical cavities and traps. We investigate three different routes to this end. For moderate coupling, we attempt to generate quantum entanglement probabilistically, projecting ions to an entangled state upon detecting photons emitted from the cavity. For stronger coupling, deterministic transfer of quantum states between ions and photons is possible. In order to maximize the coupling, we will employ ultra-small fibre cavities, closely fitted to the electrode structure of the ion trap. Entanglement of ions in a cavity may even be generated through the exchange of virtual photons. In this case, a miniature linear ion trap is used.
