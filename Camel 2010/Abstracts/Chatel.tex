The energy states in semiconductor quantum dots are discrete as in atoms, and quantum
states can be coherently controlled with resonant laser pulses.  Here, we report on the robust preparation of a quantum state using  rapid adiabatic passage from the ground to an excited state through excitation with laser pulses whose frequency is swept in time through the resonance. This observation in photoluminescence experiments is made possible by introducing a novel detection scheme for the resonant electron hole pair (exciton) generation. This is the first experimental demonstration of rapid adiabatic passage in single quantum dot and opens the route towards coherent control scheme in such system.
