We develop an effective two-level model that describes dephasing effects in a tripod configuration.
Our analysis makes use of the adiabatic approximation, in the weak dephasing regime. An effective
master equation for a two-level system formed by two dark states is derived. Solutions are utilized
in terms of two-level crossing models. The population and coherences exponentially decay with
respect to the relaxation rates, whereas for adiabatic evolution the pulse delay has an inverse effect, depending on the pulse ordering. The fidelity of the final coherent state deteriorates for increasing decay rates, and increases when the pulse delay is increased.
