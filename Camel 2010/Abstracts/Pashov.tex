The progress in the laser cooling and trapping of atoms set new requirements for the molecular spectroscopy. Usually concentrated on the equilibrium distance properties of the system of two bound atoms, now the spectroscopists concentrated on the long-range properties of the molecular potentials. In this contribution the recent results of these spectroscopic studies will be presented with an accent set on the application of modeling interactions between two cold atoms and the formation of cold molecules.
