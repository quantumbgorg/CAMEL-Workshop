We discuss both theoretically and experimentally an elementary two-photon polarization entanglement
localization after break of entanglement caused by linear coupling of environmental photon
with one of the system photons [1]. The localization of entanglement is based on simple polarization
measurement of the surrounding photon after the coupling. We demonstrate that non-zero entanglement
can be localized back irrespectively to the distinguishability of coupled photons.
Further, it can be increased by local single-copy polarization filters up to an amount violating Bell inequalities [2]. The present technique allows to restore entanglement in that cases, when the entanglement distillation does not produce any entanglement out of the coupling.
