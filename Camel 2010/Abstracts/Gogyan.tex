The success of many tasks in optical quantum information processing crucially depends on the generation of high-quality single-photon (SP) states. To make a good SP source one has to ensure suppression of both the multi-photon and the zero-photon state, as well as to eliminate the entanglement between the photons which degrades the purity of the SP state.
We propose a mechanism to produce indistinguishable single-photon pulses on demand from an optical cavity. The sequences of two laser pulses generate, at the two Raman transitions of a four-level atom, the same  cavity-mode photons without repumping of the atom between photon generations. Photons are emitted from the cavity with near-unit efficiency in well-defined temporal modes of identical shapes controlled by the laser fields. The second order correlation function reveals the single-photon nature of the proposed source. A realistic setup for the experimental implementation is presented.
