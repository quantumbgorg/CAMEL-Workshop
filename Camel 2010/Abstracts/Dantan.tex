I will present recent CQED experiments with ion Coulomb crystals in optical cavities. By placing a moderately high-finesse cavity inside a linear ion trap and using large ensembles of ions, laser-cooled into a Coulomb crystal, it is possible to operate in the collective strong coupling regime of CQED at the single photon level. I will report on recent observations of cavity Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in such a system and discuss their applications for the realization of cavity EIT-based quantum memories as well as for the observation of photon blockade effects at the single photon level.
