We study the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations in the
presence of decoherence. We discover a class of initial states for
which the quantum correlations, quantified by the quantum discord,
are not destroyed by decoherence for times $t<t^*$. In this
initial time interval only classical correlations decay. For $t>t^*$,
on the other hand, classical correlations do not change in
time and only quantum correlations are lost due to the interaction
with the environment. Therefore, at the transition time $t^*$
the open system dynamics exhibits a sudden transition from classical to
quantum decoherence regime.
