We investigate the ultrafast charge transfer dynamics after photo-ionization of an outer-valence
electron on a C$_{60}$-pyrene hybrid compound. We study the cationic charge density evolution during
the first few femtoseconds after photo-ionization within one-particle theory, including post-Hartree-
Fock corrections. We observe a partial charge flow from the C$_{60}$ towards the pyrene unit of the
light-harvesting compound within about 3 femtoseconds after ionization. The charge flow appears
oscillatory with a period strongly dependent on the level of post-HF theory used.
