There are two well known mechanisms which lead to lifting of energy spin degeneracy of single electron systems -- magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling. We explore the possibility for existence of a third mechanism in which electrostatic field can lead to lifting of spin-degeneracy directly without the mediation of spin-orbit coupling.
