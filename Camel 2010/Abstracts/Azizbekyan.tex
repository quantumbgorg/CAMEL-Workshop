Cold molecule formation via coherent photo- or magneto-association of ultracold atoms is discussed within the Demkov-Kunike model. The model is realized as a bell-shaped pulse and resonance-crossing detuning of finite variation. A recently proposed two-term ansatz that describes the relevant quadratic-nonlinear version of the level-crossing problem is analyzed. Three distinct interaction regimes (weak, intermediate and strong coupling limits) are revealed in the case of the large detuning variation range with a large resonance sweep rate. It is shown that the ansatz accurately describes the whole temporal dynamics of the association process in all the mentioned interaction regimes. A nonlinear saturation in this regime of interaction is found. Regardless of pulse area, this saturation limits the atom to molecule conversion probability that the system can reach. Comparison is made with the Landau-Zener model where the full conversion of atoms into molecules is theoretically possible.
