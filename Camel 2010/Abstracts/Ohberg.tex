In this talk we will show how a gas of ultracold atoms can be described by an effective Dirac equation. The underlying machinery for
creating such a gas is based on optically induced gauge potentials and dark state dynamics. We will briefly outline the concept of
artificial electromagnetism and illustrate this by looking at confinement mechanisms in the gas, a concept which is also known from
quantum chromodynamics and high energy physics.
