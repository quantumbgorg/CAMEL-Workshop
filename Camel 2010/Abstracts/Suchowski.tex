I will present an analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation
in four level systems. A natural extension of the known Rabi solution in two-level systems will be shown, where instead of one generalized (Rabi) frequency that governs the two level case,
two distinct generalized frequencies dictate the four mode dynamics. I will also show how Pythagorean triples, which are the set of three integer numbers ($a$; $b$; $c$), satisfying the
Pythagorean equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, are found to play a significant role in the
requirements of complete population transfer in a four-level system.
The application of this solution to several classical and quantum problems will be discussed as well.
