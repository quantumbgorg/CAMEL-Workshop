A new method for efficient, broadband sum and difference frequency generation of ultrafast pulses is demonstrated. We demonstrate an analogy between frequency conversion and coherent optical excitation of a two-level system.  This allows for the adaptation of well-known rapid adiabatic passage techniques to the context of frequency conversion. The scheme was implemented using aperiodically poled nonlinear crystals and a single step nonlinear mixing process. To date, broadband ultrafast conversion efficiencies up to 50\% have been generated.
