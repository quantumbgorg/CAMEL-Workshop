We shall analyze a performance of the hybrid quantum repeater
scheme in an idealized case of perfect quantum memory
as well as in a more realistic case of finite memory time.
Formulas for the rates that can be obtained in this scheme were
calculated analytically by probabilistic combinatorial
methods. This analytical approach makes our results unique because
typically such a rate analysis is done by purely numerical calculations.
