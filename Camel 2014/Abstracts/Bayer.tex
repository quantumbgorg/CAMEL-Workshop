Direct ultrafast manipulation of electron motion has emerged as a new perspective in chemical reaction control. Efficient steering of photochemical events is achieved by intense femtosecond laser pulses, precisely tailored to the laser-induced charge dynamics. Recently we reported on a fundamental mechanism of resonant strong-field control based on the Selective Population of Dressed States (SPODS) [Wollenhaupt et al.: CPL 419, 184-190 (2006)]. The scenario allows ultrafast switching of electronic excitation between different target channels with high efficiency and selectively. The potential of SPODS for efficient ultrafast switching is discussed on a generic multi-level system and demonstrated experimentally on the strong-field control of concerted electron-nuclear dynamics in potassium molecules.
