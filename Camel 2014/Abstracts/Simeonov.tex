We present an analytically exactly solvable two-state quantum model, in which the coupling has a hyperbolic-tangent
temporal shape and the frequency detuning is constant. The exact solution is expressed in terms of
associated Legendre functions. An interesting feature of this model is that the excitation probability does not
vanish, except for zero pulse area or zero detuning; this feature is attributed to the asymmetric pulse shape.
Two limiting cases are considered. When the coupling rises very slowly, it is nearly linear and the tanh model
reduces to the shark model introduced earlier. When the coupling rises very quickly, the tanh model reduces to
the Rabi model, which assumes a rectangular pulse shape and hence a sudden switch on. Because of its practical
significance, we have elaborated the asymptotics of the solution in the Rabi limit, and we have derived the next
terms in the asymptotic expansion, which deliver the corrections to the amplitude and the phase of the Rabi
oscillations due to the finite rise time of the coupling.
