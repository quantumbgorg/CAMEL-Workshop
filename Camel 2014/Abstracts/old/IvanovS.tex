We present a novel method for quantum computing with trapped ions in a magnetic field gradient. The method builds upon the visionary idea of Mintert, F. and Wunderlich, C. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 257904 (2001)] for implementing quantum logic gates with microwave and radiowave radiation. A series of collective and local operations is applied, where the latter are achieved by standard spin-magnetic resonance and the former occur naturally due to the magnetic field gradient. The method is an alternative to standard computational approach and substitutes the universal gates with operations that are implemented naturally with trapped ions in a single interaction.
