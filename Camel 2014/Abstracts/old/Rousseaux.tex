We derive an adiabatic technique that synthesizes the most general SU($d$) transformation in a quantum system of $d$ degenerate states, featuring a qudit.
This technique is based on the factorization of SU($d$) transformation in to $d$ generalized quantum Householder reflections (QHR), each of which is implemented by a two-shot stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) with appropriate static phases. The energy of the lasers needed to synthesize a single Householder reflection is shown to be remarkably constant as a function of $d$. This technique is directly applicable to a linear trapped ion system with $d+1$ ions. We implement the quantum Fourier transform numerically in a quartit (qudit with $d=4$) as an example.
