Adiabatic evolution of light in parallel curved optical waveguide array is theoretically
investigated. This problem is shown to bear a close connection with the process of coherent
population transfer in a ``bow-tie'' model for atoms and molecules. Under certain conditions,
complete light transfer between the outer waveguides is achieved; these conditions impose certain
restrictions on the geometry of the waveguides and the optical properties of the system. A special
attention is paid to the case of three waveguides, which is analyzed using the solutions of the
well-known ``bow-tie'' model. The analytic solution is used to design recipes for creating arbitrary
superpositions of light intensity between the waveguides, with possible applications in achromatic
optical multiple-beam splitters. For more than three waveguides the numerical results shows
possibility for complete light transfer between the outer waveguides and for creating equal
superposition of light intensity. This technique is reversible.
