Driving on an analogy with the technique of composite pulses in quantum
physics, we theoretically propose a broadband Faraday rotator and thus a broadband optical
isolator, which is composed of sequences of ordinary Faraday rotators and
achromatic quarter-wave plates rotated at the predetermined angles.
