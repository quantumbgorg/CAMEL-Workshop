It is often assumed that cavity-mediated laser cooling is essentially the same as free-space laser
cooling. Here we show that this does not apply when an external trap strongly confines the motion
of a particle in the direction of the cavity axis. In this case, the stationary state phonon number
exhibits three sharp minima as a function of the cavity-laser detuning due to a direct atom-phonon-
photon coupling term in the system Hamiltonian. For a wide range of experimental parameters, a
previously unconsidered resonance yields the lowest stationary state phonon number. This might be
especially well-suited for the cooling of many-particle systems.
