I will review different classes of 1-D quantum spin models whose ground states exhibit features ranging from ground-state factorization and long-distance entanglement to quantum frustration and symmetry-protected topological order. I will then discuss the possibility to use atom-optical platforms, in particular systems of trapped ions and superconducting qubits, in order to simulate/realize such model Hamiltonians endowed with complex quantum behaviours.
