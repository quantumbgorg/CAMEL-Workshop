We will present a simplified method for the implementation of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) with trapped ions in a magnetic field gradient. Instead of the two-qubit c-phase gates, we use free evolution to entangle the qubits. An $N$-dimensional QFT matrix is produced with a series of $2N$ resonant pulses separated by proper time delays, as opposed to $O(N^2)$ as in standard proposals.
