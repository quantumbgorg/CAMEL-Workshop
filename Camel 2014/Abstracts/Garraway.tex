Cold atoms can be ``dressed'' with radio-frequency and microwave radiation resulting in applications to sensing, metrology and interferometry. The wide range of applications is due to the flexibility inherent in the vector coupling of a magnetic dipole moment to EM fields which can be varied in time, frequency, orientation and space. This talk will introduce the concept of the dressed atom, and present both old and new designs of ring traps [1,2] and race tracks [3].
