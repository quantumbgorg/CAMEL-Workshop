In this talk we present recent progress towards the implementation of a four-level lasing without inversion (LWI) scheme in mercury.
It is based on theoretical calculations by Fry [1] and aims at demonstrating LWI based UV cw-lasers at 253.7
nm. Laser radiation of two lasers, both of which are at much longer wavelength than that of the LWI laser output, is required to set
up the necessary coherence in a mercury filled gas cell. The particular alignment of the lasers enables compensation for the Doppler
effect leading to high efficiency. During the talk we will present detailed numerical simulations concerning the experimental
realization as well as the present status of the experiment.
