We extend the definition of entanglement witnesses based on structure factors to the case in which the position
of the scatterers is quantized. This allows us to study entanglement detection in hybrid systems.
We consider several examples showing how these extra degrees of freedom affect entanglement detection by directly contributing to
the measurement statistics.
We specialize the proposed witness operator to trapped ion crystals. Within this framework, we show how the collective vibronic state
of the ions can act as an undesired quantum environment and how the ions motion can affect the entanglement detection.
Finally, we investigate some specific cases where the method proposed leads to detection of hybrid entanglement.
