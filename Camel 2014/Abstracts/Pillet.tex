In frozen Rydberg gases, efficient long-range dipole-dipole interactions can lead to efficient transfer of population by exchange of
internal energy between two Rydberg atoms. These Forster resonances can be matched by adding a small static electric field for
shifting the Rydberg levels. They can be generalized to the case of a few Rydberg atoms. We will present the case of three atoms in
the case of cesium.
