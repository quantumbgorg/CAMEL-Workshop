To this point, entanglement operations on ion qubits have predominantly been performed using lasers.
When scaling to larger qubit numbers however this becomes problematic due to the challenging
engineering that might be required. The use of microwaves combined with a static magnetic field
gradient overcomes this problem. I will present our work towards implementing entanglement gates using
microwave radiation including the experimental demonstration of Schr\"{o}dinger cat states and the first
realisation of driving motional sideband transitions with microwave dressed states. I will also
present our work creating microfabricated ion trap architectures for quantum simulation and quantum
computation.
