We analyse the system of $\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity QED of semi-transparent mirror and driven by laser fields. We derive effective models and connect concepts (photonic flux, input-output operators, photonic state) characterizing the propagation of the resulting leaking photons. We propose an atom-cavity non-resonant scheme for single- and 2-photon generation. The pulse shapes of outgoing single photons are tailored using a specifically designed driving field envelope. For the production of 2-photon states, two trapped atoms are used with two driving pulses. Their pulse shapes are characterized and it is shown that the multiphoton outgoing photonic states cannot be Fock states, since the photons are not generated strictly simultaneously.
