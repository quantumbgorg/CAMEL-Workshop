Here, we present recent experimental and theoretical progress in the realization of a single-ion heat engine. We perform analytical and numerical modeling of the dynamical behaviors of the engine under the driving of thermal and non-thermal baths. A convenient and sensitive method to characterize unknown heat baths is developed. To realize the measurement, a controlled bath with a known temperature is required for reference. The unknown bath to be tested and the reference bath interact with the ion periodically. The characterization of the unknown bath is extracted from the evolution of the ionâ€™s axial oscillation. The sensitivity of this method is analyzed and compared to traditional methods of temperature measurement.
