In quantum optics, the dressed atom proved to be a useful concept for Cohen-Tannoudji and Reynaud in the analysis of resonance fluorescence from an atom back in 1977 [1]. More recently it has been found that by adiabatically dressing atoms with radio-frequency and microwave radiation we can produce a variety of different types of spatial trap for ultra-cold atoms (see reviews in Refs. [2, 3]). In this talk we will see how shell potentials can be fine tuned [4] and the results and applications for probing RF dressed potentials with microwave pulses [5].
