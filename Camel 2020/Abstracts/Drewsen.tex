We present a general framework for simulating the expected photon recoil spectra in unresolved sideband limits where either the natural line width of a target ion or the spectral width of the exciting light source significantly exceed the motional frequencies (typically 0.1-1 MHz). To exemplify, the two complementary cases, spectroscopy is considered of the rather broad 2S1/2 - 2P3/2 electronic transition (41.8 MHz) of a single Mg$^+$ ion at 279.6 nm by a narrow laser source ($< 1$ MHz), and mid-infrared vibrational spectroscopy of the very narrow $\left|v = 0, J = 1\right\rangle - \left|vâ€™= 1, J' = 0\right\rangle$ transition (2.5 Hz) at 6.17 $\mu$m in the 1S$^+$ ground state potential of MgH$^+$ by a broadband laser source ($\approx$ 10 MHz). Finally, to valid our model, we make comparisons with spectroscopic results obtained on the 24Mg$^+$ ion.
