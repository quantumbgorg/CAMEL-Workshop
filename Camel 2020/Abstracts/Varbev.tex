We consider the dynamics of a periodic quantum XY spin chain exposed to a complex
electromagnetic field consisting of two components â€“ a constant homogeneous magnetic and a quantized circularly polarized single electromagnetic fields. The interaction between the spins and a mode from the electromagnetic field is modeled by the Dicke Hamiltonian. The rotating wave approximation is applied and the domain of its validity is discussed. At the beginning of the dynamic process there is one excitation in the electromagnetic field, the model is exactly solvable in sense that all physical quantities could be expressed in a closed form.
