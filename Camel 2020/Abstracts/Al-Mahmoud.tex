An optical polarization rotator is an element that rotates the polarization of a linearly polarized input wave by a fixed angle that is independent of the input polarization direction. In order to make a broadband rotator, we theoretically proposed and experimentally verified a simple rotatorâ€™s scheme. It is composed of only three ($N=3$) waveplates: a full-wave plate retarder (i.e. phase shift between polarization components $\phi=-2\pi$) is sandwiched between two half-wave plates retarders ($\phi=\pi$)). Such a simple composite polarization rotator is shown to be very robust against variations of the individual wave plates retardations. This leads to a broadband operation with full agreement between theoretical expectations and experimental results [1]. The above scheme can be easily tuned since the rotation angle can be changed by rotating only one of the half-wave plates. Besides the three wave-plates rotator, we will also discuss alternative composite-pulses-inspired broadband schemes composed of an even numbers of half-wave plates retarders ($N$ = 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10) [2].
