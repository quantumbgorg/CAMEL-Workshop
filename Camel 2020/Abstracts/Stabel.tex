As a key component of quantum repeaters, quantum memories for single photons are a central component in future, large scale quantum communication networks. Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a prominent protocol to implement a quantum memory by stopping and storing light. In our work we apply EIT in a praseodymium doped yttrium orthosilicate crystal (Pr:YSO) to provide a solid-state memory. The protocol and specific medium allow us to reach both high storage efficiencies and long storage times [1,2]. While we already demonstrated EIT for efficient and long-term storage of classical pulses in Pr:YSO, we aim now at storage of weak coherent pulses in the regime of a single photon. This requires sophisticated techniques for filtering and background suppression. As a basic component towards this goal, in our setup we apply a second, optically prepared Pr:YSO crystal for narrowband spectral filtering. Combined with other measures, this enabled our first successful demonstration of a solid-state EIT-driven quantum memory at the single photon level.
