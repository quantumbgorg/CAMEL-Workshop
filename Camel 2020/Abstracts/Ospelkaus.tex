Trapped ions are on of the experimentally most advanced system for the implementation of large-scale quantum computation. I will present strategies to achieve robust entangling gate operation based on pulse shaping and show experimental results on an integrated microwave two-qubit gate with infidelities approaching $10^{-3}$. I will discuss designs to combine this integrated gate mechanism with physical ion shuttling operations to build a small-scale quantum processor ``chip'', where all the elementary logic operations are carried out using chip-integrated microwave control.
