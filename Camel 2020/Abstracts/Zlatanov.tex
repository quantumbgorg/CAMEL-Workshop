We investigate coherent control techniques of multilevel quantum systems involving a laser induced continuum structure(LICS). Up to our knowledge such schemes have only been investigated in idealised two and three level systems, which undermines the potential gains. Systems with a higher number of initial and final states, both degenerate and non-degenerate, pose a much harder problem to solve, but promise a larger reward.

In standard multilevel systems, under specific conditions, a manifold of ground states excited through an intermediate level structure to a different manifold of target states can be reduced to independent systems of two level states by the famous Morris-Shore transformation. We explore a similar situation in which the intermediate level is a continuum  state. Our goal is to layout the exact control tools for population trapping among the manifold of target states, and derive novel techniques for efficiency  improvement of the process.
