The present talk is devoted to some computational aspects of the highly intriguing phenomenon, the \textit{entanglement} of quantum states.
Namely, few steps are undertaken towards the description of the \textit{qubit--qutrit} pair ---
quantum bipartite system composed of two and three level subsystems.
Calculations of the Molien functions and Poincar\'{e} series for the qubit-qubit and qubit-qutrit \textit{local unitary invariants}
are outlined and compared with the known results.
The requirement of the positive semi-definiteness of the density operator is formulated explicitly as a set of inequalities in
five Casimir invariants of the enveloping algebra su(6).
