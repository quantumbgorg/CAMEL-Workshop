The preparation and control of quantum states in a quick and robust way is of the utmost importance for future quantum technologies. So far, the most robust state preparation techniques were provided by adiabatic processes. Nevertheless, in many cases adiabatic processes take too long and become impractical since their slowness makes them extremely sensitive to decoherence and noise. A lot of theoretical and experimental activity has started recently to develop new schemes, called ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' -- to speed up adiabatic processes while keeping their robustness. We will give an overview about the field of ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' and especially present the newest results.
