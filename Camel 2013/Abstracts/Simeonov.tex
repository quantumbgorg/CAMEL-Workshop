We show a way to improve on the Sorensen-Molmer's gate with utilization of fast bichromatic laser fields interacting with ions in ion trap. With a sequence of two pulses it is possible to change the internal ion state without exciting additional phonon vibrations. In addition the operation of the gate does not depend on the initial vibrational modes. The time required for the vibrational modes to return to their initial state is much less than Sorensen-Molmer's gate.
