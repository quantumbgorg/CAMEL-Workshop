A series of both theoretical and experimental papers on alkali-alkaline-earth molecules appeared within the last few years. The interest in this class of molecules is mainly due to the
possibility to produce cold polar molecules with the goal of further applications for example in quantum computing and fundamental physics. High resolution spectroscopic studies,
however, are limited to LiCa  and LiBa. This is probably due to the more difficult way to produce sufficient concentration of molecules in the gas phase and because of the overlap with
the usually much stronger spectra of the dimer of the corresponding alkali-metal partner. In this contribution a current status of the spectroscopic research in this field will be reported
with accent on the new experimental results in LiSr, CaK and SrRb.
