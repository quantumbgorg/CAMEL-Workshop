I will give an overview over my group’s activities on the dynamics of ultracold Bose gases confined to lattice potentials. We have studied the macroscopic transport of a superfluid sample of Rb atoms through the lattice and have mapped out its potential and limitations [1]. By means of Mott-insulator state, we have detected ultra-narrow Feshbach resonances that have widths in the micro-Gauss range [2]. We have probed the dynamics of a dense, interacting sample of doublons and have found a strong asymmetry for repulsive vs. attractive interactions [3], in contrast to what we have observed for dilute samples. In one dimension, we have probed the dynamics of a strongly coupled impurity atom injected into a Luttinger-type liquid and have found an intriguing Bloch-oscillation type motion induced in the correlated system in the absence of an imprinted lattice structure [4].
