High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is a promising tabletop source of coherent short wavelength radiation. Driving HHG with MHz repetition rate requires tight focusing, resulting in a reduced interaction volume. Generating in a gas-filled photonic crystal fiber (PCF) mitigates this problem and enables wavelength-tunable XUV generation with few-$\mu$J laser pulses up to unprecedented high photon energies approaching the aluminium L-edge (72.8 eV). However, phase-matching HHG in PCF is technologically challenging and quasi-phase matching is an attractive approach capable of enhancing the average XUV flux by orders of magnitude.
