Single self-assembled quantum dots are established emitters of single photons and entangled photon pairs. Nevertheless, to be used in quantum information experiments quantum dots need to be excited resonantly and coherently. 
We report coherently created biexciton-exciton photon cascade in a single self-assembled InAs quantum dot embedded in a microcavity. The resonant nature of the excitation was confirmed by the observation of the Rabi oscillations. Due to the deterministic nature of the excitation process the measurements of the auto-correlations of both exciton and biexciton photons show the full suppression of multiple photon emission. 
The use of resonant excitation makes this system well suitable for schemes like time-bin entanglement or probabilistic interaction of the photons originating from dissimilar sources.
