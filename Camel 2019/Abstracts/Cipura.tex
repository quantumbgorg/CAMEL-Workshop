We investigate harmonic generation of ultra-short, picosecond (ps) pump laser pulses towards the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) spectral regime, enhanced by preparation of dressed states in media of rare gas atoms. A control laser, with appropriately matched frequency and/or peak intensity serves to generate dressed states with large, tunable Autler-Townes (AT) splittings in the THz range. The energetic position of the dressed states is laser-controlled to match with an odd number of pump laser photons. This enables resonance enhancement of harmonic generation also for typically fixed-frequency and off-resonant pump laser pulses. Moreover, the tunable AT splittings also serve to compensate for inevitable Stark shifts of atomic resonances, which otherwise reduce the nonlinear response of the medium. We provide convincing experimental data to demonstrate the concept in argon and xenon, yielding enhancements of harmonic generation by 1-2 orders of magnitude.
