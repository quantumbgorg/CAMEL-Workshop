When applying an electric field, it has long been observed that resonant dipole-dipole interactions can arise between 2 Rydberg atoms [1]. Recently we have demonstrated the possibility to find resonant processes involving 3 Rydberg atoms of cesium [2] and then with rubidium [3]. 
As the observed three-body resonance appears at a different electric field than the two-body resonance, it represents an effective three-body operator, which can be used to directly control the three-body interactions. This can be especially useful in quantum simulations and quantum information processing with neutral atoms in optical lattices. I will present our theoretical study of the coherence of this interaction and its applicability to develop a quantum gate [4,5].
