Trapped ions are on of the experimentally most advanced system for the implementation of large-scale quantum computation. I will discuss the implementation of quantum logic operations with 9Be$^+$ ions in surface-electrode ion traps and the realization of an entangling two-qubit gate using near-field microwaves. I will present the current error budget and discuss strategies to approach 0.01\% error rates. In the second part of my talk, I will discuss an experiment where we aim to implement sympathetic cooling of (anti-)protons by 9Be$^+$ ions in a cryogenic Penning trap within the BASE collaboration. We have recently trapped clouds and single 9Be$^+$ ions, demonstrated laser cooling and are now working to implement sympathetic laser cooling in multi-well potentials.
