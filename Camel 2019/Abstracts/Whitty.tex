We design fast and robust transport protocols for a quantum particle in non-harmonic traps. 
We accomplish this through developing and applying an extension to existing Shortcuts to Adiabaticity techniques. We consider several examples of non-harmonic traps and examine the final fidelity of the transport protocol for different transport times. Further applications of the extended Shortcuts to Adiabaticity formalism will be discussed.
