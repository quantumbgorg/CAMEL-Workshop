We experimentally demonstrate broadband and ultra-broadband spectral
bandwidth polarization rotators. The broadband polarization rotator
comprises an array of rotated multi-order half-wave plates, respectively the
ultra-broadband polarization rotator comprises an array of rotated
commercial achromatic half-wave plates. The broadband and ultra-broadband performance of the
polarization rotators is due to the adiabatic nature of the light evolution
and in this paper we experimentally investigate the performance of broadband
and ultra-broadband polarization rotators comprising by either ten multi
order half-wave plates or ten commercial achromatic half-wave plates. The
half-wave plates in the array are rotated smoothly from alignment between
the fast-polarization axes and initial linear polarized light to the desired
polarization angles.
