A variant of the Landau-Zener model corresponding to the case where both bare energies and dressed energies of a two-level
system approach zero is studied. This circumstance occurs when the off-diagonal terms (the interaction) of the relevant
Hamiltonian vanish at the same time when the diagonal terms (the bare energies) become zero. A very simple analytical
formula expressing the probability of non adiabatic transitions is obtained. The physical origin of such transitions is discussed
and found to have some resemblance to a symmetry breaking process.
