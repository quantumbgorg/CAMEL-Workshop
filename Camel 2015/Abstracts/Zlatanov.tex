An exact analytic solution for the optical Bloch equation is presented for coherent
resonant excitation of a two-state quantum system. The system is driven by a
pulsed external field described by Demkov model in the presence
of dephasing. We investigate the system in the positive time interval and assume
that at initial times the system is entirely in its ground state. The time evolution is
obtained by solving a third order differential equation for the population inversion.
The solution is given in terms of hypergeometric functions. We suggest approximate
asymptotic solutions for the population inversion of the system after the effect
of the external field. The solutions consider the on and off resonance regimes of
the system for small and large values of the dephasing in each regime.
