We propose quantum sensing scheme for measuring weak forces and magnetic fields based on the process of symmetry-breaking quantum Dicke phase transition. We show that the system described by the Dicke Hamiltonian can serves as a sensor of extremely weak forces with sensitivity in the yN Hz$^{-1/2}$ range. Using the Dicke system as a magnetic field sensor we estimate sensitivity to few pT Hz$^{-1/2}$. We focus on the particular implementation of our sensing protocols using linear ion crystal.
