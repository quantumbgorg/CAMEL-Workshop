We examine the method of composite pulses and its application for quantum control. The technique
of composite pulses uses a sequence of pulses with relative phases, used as control parameters. We show how composite pulses can be used to improve different adiabatic techniques (RAP and
STIRAP). Then we show how we can construct simple quantum gates, using composite pulses. As an
example we examine the two-state quantum phase gate. Finally, we present a method to construct
ultra-broadband and ultra-narrowband composite pulses, which produce better excitation profiles
at the expense of a finite error tolerance.
