The ever growing need for energy-efficient and fast communications is driving the development of highly integrated photonic circuits where controlling light at the nanoscale becomes the most critical aspect of information transfer. Coherent couplers, two coherently interacting optical waveguides placed in close proximity, are important building blocks in these integrated photonics circuits and have been employed as optical modulators and switches for high speed communication, data processing and integrated quantum operations. In the talk, I will share with you our recent development of a unique scheme of adiabatic elimination (AE) modulation for active control of the coupling among waveguides in Silicon photonics. Analogous to atomic systems, AE is achieved by applying a decomposition on a three waveguide coupler, where the two outer waveguides serve as an effective two-mode system analogous to the ground and excited states in an atomic three level system and the middle waveguide is the equivalent to the intermediate level `dark state'.

We experimentally demonstrate the first all optical AE modulation and its ability to control the coupling between the two waveguides by manipulating the mode index of the middle one. As the AE procedure separates the information channel from the control, it reduces significantly two-photon absorption (TPA) and TPA-induced free carrier absorption, which are major obstacles in Silicon photonics. In addition, we show that the strong modes interactions allowed at the nano-scale offer a unique configuration of zero-coupling between all the waveguides, a phenomena that go beyond the AE scheme in atomic physics, and is expected to lays down the foundation for ultra dense integrated photonic circuits and nano-scale modulators.
