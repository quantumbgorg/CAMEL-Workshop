Adiabatic evolution of light in optical waveguide array is theoretically investigated. We
consider a system with three waveguides, one of them is contra-directional to the others. The
propagator and the transition probabilities are calculated for the both cases -- contra-directional propagation of light in one of the outer waveguides and contra-directional
propagation of light in the middle waveguide. The analytic results are compared with numerical
calculations.
