The signal to noise ratio of quantum sensing protocols scales with the square root of the coherence time. Thus, increasing this time
is a key goal in the field. By utilizing quantum error correction, I will present a novel way of prolonging such coherence times beyond
the fundamental limits of current techniques. I will present an implementable sensing protocol that incorporates error correction, and
discuss the characteristics of these protocols in different noise and measurement scenarios.
