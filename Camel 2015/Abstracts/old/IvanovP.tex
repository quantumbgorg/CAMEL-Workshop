We present a system for the simulation of Heisenberg models with spins $s=\frac{1}{2}$ and $s=1$ with a linear crystal of trapped ions. We show that the laser-ion interaction induces a Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard interaction between the atomic V-type level structure and the two phonon species. In the strong-coupling regime the collective atom and phonon excitations become localized at each lattice site and form an effective spin system with varying length. We show that the quantum-mechanical superexchange interaction caused the the second-order phonon hopping processes creates a Heisenberg-type coupling between the individual spins. Trapped ions allow to control the superechange interactions by adjusting the trapping frequencies, the laser interansity, and the detuning.
