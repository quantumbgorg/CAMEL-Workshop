Single neutral atoms are promising candidates for qubits, the fundamental unit of quantum
information. We have developed a device for cooling and trapping arrays of up to 20 rubidium atoms in
1 $\mu$m dipole traps. The traps are created using a computer-generated hologram displayed on a
digital mirror device (DMD). The high frame rate of the DMD (20 kHz), along with our optimised
hologram algorithm [1], will allow each atom to be rearranged independently in real time. We present
results for trapping and rearranging single atoms, and discuss future prospects for combining these
dipole traps with miniature fibre-tip optical cavities for cQED experiments.
