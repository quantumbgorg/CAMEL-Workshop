By developing the methods of radio-frequency dressing of ultra-cold atoms [1], and by extending this to the microwave regime [2] we have been able to create new types of traps for atoms with potential applications for Sagnac interferometry and atomtronics. By using wire lattices we have also designed new 2D lattice potentials [3] which do not involve optical fields and can be used for quantum simulation. These lattices are highly flexible and can be arranged as a regular lattice, dipolar lattice, or ladder lattice. The designs and applications will be reported in this presentation.
