I will present an overview of the studies we have conducted in
Laboratoire Aim\'e Cotton on few-body interactions arising in a gas of
ultracold cesium atoms excited to Rydberg levels.

We have first demonstrated a 4-body interaction in a specific energy
exchange resonance. This configuration is however not suitable for
potential applications because it corresponds to a coincidence in cesium
probably hard to reproduce in any other atom and because it occurs
together with strong 2-body interactions.

We have now observed 3-body interactions which can be generalized to any
atom and which resonance occurs at electric fields far from the 2-body
resonance such that the 3-body process is dominant which promises
interesting applications for quantum information purposes.

As a perspective on cold Rydberg atoms, I will present the status of our
new experiment on Ytterbium atoms which aims at using the second valence
electron to apply optical manipulations on Rydberg atoms.
