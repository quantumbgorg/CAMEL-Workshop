In this talk we present recent progress in our lab concerning various applications of lasers. In the first part of the talk we discuss the progress of our Brillouin LIDAR  for the measurement of the temperature profile in the Ocean. The first lab based measurements of the complete system demonstrate real-time capability of depth resolved measurements. Currently a field test is in preparation.

During the second part of the talk we will detail the status of our realization of a UV laser based on lasing without inversion. A recent theoretical study has shown the feasibility of our approach employing a four level double dark scheme  in mercury [1]. In the meantime all lasers necessary for the implementation have been set up.  During the talk we will discuss the current status of the experimental realization.
