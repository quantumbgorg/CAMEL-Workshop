The action of an environment can be made beneficial to quantum technologies by engineering its quantum noise to generate or protect quantum resources. This goal calls for efficient ways to detect and control the relevant properties of quantum environments. One such property is the environment spectral density, which has a crucial role in dictating the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system coupled to the environment.

We consider structured environments modeled by quantum networks of harmonic bosonic nodes and answer the following questions: what kind of spectral densities do complex quantum networks have and how can they be controlled and probed? The results show that the spectral density can be very accurately detected via a locally immersed probe system for virtually any network configuration when the network is in a thermal state of known temperature.
